*Thanks google for translating the title.*

The version 6 of my personal webspace has started and the main reason to do this is to overcome the patch up job that I did with the last version. V5's design was quite extensive in terms of time that I spent on it and the implementation of those ideas and its iteration. I had ideas on extending that version but didn't really pan out after I lost access to my old machine and the whole setup, in terms of design assets and things went along with it. Then, I had to transition to a new country, workplace and projects. This eventually lead to losing focus and the extra time I used to spend on my site. and replacing it with this intermediate journal for now. The idea is to design and develop the v6 in open. To be honest, I haven't really spent much time on iterating v6. Sometime later in this week, I will drop another journal with all my hazy thoughts on it. The ideas are in a very primitive stage and maybe its the right time to record them and start the work simultaneously.

I am also planning to turn the blog into a journal, so that I can drop my rough ideas and observations without having to polish them much. And also for some odd reason, blogging kinda feels a bit more formal compared to journals. Besides the name change, this time around I am also planning to publish audio journals once in a while. I have done some audio logs in the past but all of those logs were done offline and I think I have lost those logs when transitioning to Dubai. I loathe losing those logs since there were around 15 logs or so, and each of it was recorded in a different time in the past. I started this as an habit during my college days and thats the time when I didn't know about podcasting and audio books. Anyway, I didn't intent to publish the logs at that time since it didn't strike me to do so.

On the whole, I am just really excited to see this space getting re-activated.
