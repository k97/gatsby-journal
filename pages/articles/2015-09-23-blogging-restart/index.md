After the last iteration, this space has been dormant for a while. It's mainly because I lost the development setup of the blog module and redoing the setup meant spending more time than I could manage. Even then, I tried couple of times to get the setup done, but had to drop it midway through since it was messing with my mainstream project’s environment. It's pain in the butt to do project setups on a workday and not work on coding or something interesting. Besides, the ruby/java environment is notorious for these kinda things. Also, I don't mind admitting the fact that, v5 was done in a frivolous way. It's a shame cause I drafted few articles whenever I could find time and then couldn't publish it. Some of those articles were interesting ones and few were written in the heat of the moment. Anyhow, I know what needs to done and to make sure I do that, I‘m gonna record those things here.

I am also planning to turn the blog module into a journal, so that I can drop my rough ideas and observations without having to polish them much. For some odd reason, blogging feels a bit more formal compared to journals. By the time this journal is live, I would’ve taken down the v5 of my webspace. I put together this journal overnight using [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby), a static page generator which uses ReactJS/Markdown with other awesome things. Shout out to the developers, since I was planning to develop something like this using ExpressJS and then incidentally I found Gatsby which is much better than what I intended to do.

This Gatsby powered journal will be an intermediate setup until I complete v6 of my site. One of the main reasons to do that, is gather content and reuse it later when v6 is live. So far, I haven’t spent much time on planning v6 but sometime later this week, I will drop another journal with all my hazy thoughts. The concepts are in a very primitive stage, so maybe its the right time to log them and start the work simultaneously.

I remember recording audio logs in the past and saving it offline. I started it as a habit during my college days to work on my language skills and that was the time when I didn't know much about podcasting or audio journals, so that meant I didn’t value it as much as I should have. I lost these logs when transitioning to Dubai and with so much in hand at that time, I couldn’t put any effort in finding them back. It's such a shame to lose those logs since I recorded them at different timelines of my life in the past. I’d love to listen to them now cause more than the quality of the content, its the context that would’ve been interesting. It's quite common to lose digital data every now and then, so rather than despairing about it, I’m thinking about publishing audio logs as journals once in a while in this space. The idea is to keep them rough, so I don't end up spending much time on it and that will help me to keep the content flowing later in the days.

On the whole, I am just really excited to see this space getting re-activated. :)
